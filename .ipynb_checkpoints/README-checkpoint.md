A decsion tree is a predictive modeling approach that separates data into classes using a top down appraoch, with broader classes at the top and more specific classes as you travel down the tree.  
There are two types of problems you can use a decsion tree to solve: *classification* and *regression* problems. Classifiaction trees predict a discrete or categorical class label, such as ```dog``` or ```cat```. Regression trees predict a 68 continuious quanitiy or numeric output, such as ```$35.98``` or ```11.41 inces```.
